Bransfer is using your crypto exchange accounts as "payment method". As PayPal is using your VISA or MasterCard.
Different crypto exchanges provide different ways of integration. For Example with Coinbase it's simple as clicking Authorize button.
But for example with Binance you have to put your API Keys. And for this reason we ask only for Read-only API keys.
You will initate withdrawal manually and we will use read-only api keys to verify your withdrawal information and match with our records.
Right now we are working on more robust integration with Binance, which will allow to pay directly from Binance Pay App.

1. Go to Binance and [create read-only API keys](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072)
1. Copy API and Secret Key
1. Go to Bransfer [payment methods](https://connect.bransfer.io/paymentmethods)
1. Click Connect next to Binance
1. Paste newly copied keys and click Connect.

> Note that it's Read-Only API Keys. Bransfer WONT and CANT initate any trade or withdrawal on your behalf.

**Now, you are ready to process your first no-fee and instant crypto transfer with Bransfer!**
